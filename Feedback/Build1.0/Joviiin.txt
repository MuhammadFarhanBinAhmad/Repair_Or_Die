Joviin:
Upgrade dot what they mean
Auto reload
Overwhelm
Game over not working
1st level too hard
No clear instruction
Someway to regain health
Jump issue:
No point in jumping (too low and flat)
Gravity too floaty
Jump too low
Enemy too fast for jump
AI have a delay when jump

UI:
Usa image for enemy left
Bar is not enough for health info(dont know enemy give different damage)
Health bar only appear when enemy is shot(maybe)
Maybe make a smaller UI haelthbar
Ammo, look nice but is it better? Better use number?
Plying view:
Too low?
Need to bring up?
Or bring UI down as well with the floor
Trouble to look both up at UI and playing at same time is troublesome to player
Make a debug mode
